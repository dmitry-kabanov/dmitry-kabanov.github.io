      <title>Saving state for tf.function-decorated functions</title>

      <description>When you decorate a function with `tf.function` decorator, sometimes you need to keep state between invocations of this function.
The problem here is that the changes to the state will not be visible in the decorated function if the state is saved in the Python variables.
To illustrate the problem, Tensorflow 2.2 is used:
import tensorflow as tf print(tf.__version__) 2.2.0 To see the problem, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the following code. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that we need to scale a given Tensor `x` and we do it using `tf.</description>

      <description>This is an introduction to using Hyperopt library. I will use mostly terminology of machine learning (ML) as this library appeared in the ML community.
Hyperopt library is used to choose the hyperparameters, that is, parameters that must be set before the learning process. The learning process is the process of fitting a given model to some dataset, which is done by minimization of some function.
For example, when you fit model \(\hat f (x)\) by optimizing function \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( y_i - \hat f (x_i) \right)^2 + \lambda R(f), \]</description>
