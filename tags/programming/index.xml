      <description>I was learning recently about solving problems that use breadth-first search (BFS). This is a family of computer science algorithms that traverse tree data structures &amp;ldquo;by levels&amp;rdquo;. That is, starting at the root, we process all nodes on level 1, then all nodes on level 2, etc.
One typical application of BFS is to find the shortest path between the root and the given nodes.
To implement BFS, one should use the queue data structure.</description>

      <description>Often, when running a program in console, one needs to save all its output to a file. Very often, such a program writes both to the standard output (stdout) and to the standard error output (stderr). For example, by default, in a Python program the print function writes to stdout and the functions of the logging module to stderr. Therefore, one needs to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file.</description>
