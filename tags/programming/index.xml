      <title>Universal initialization in C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>For my new position, I need to improve my knowledge of the C++ programming language (which I did not use basically since 2010). So I have started reading the book Discovering Modern C++ by Peter Gottschling to get up to speed with, well, modern C++.
In this post, I would like to talk about universal initialization (a.k.a. brace-initialization) that was introduced in C++11.
The syntax for the universal initialization is the following:</description>

      <title>JavaScript: functions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As any programming language, JavaScript allows to pack useful things into
functions, and it is the key to good JavaScript knowledge, to use them
efficiently.
In this post, I describe three ways that the functions can be declared
in JavaScript,
talk about visibility of variables inside the functions,
how to have optional function arguments with default values,
how to create closures (functions, bound to outer variables),
and how to use recursion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving Perfect Squares problem using breadth-first search</title>

      <description>I was learning recently about solving problems that use breadth-first search (BFS). This is a family of computer science algorithms that traverse tree data structures &amp;ldquo;by levels&amp;rdquo;. That is, starting at the root, we process all nodes on level 1, then all nodes on level 2, etc.
One typical application of BFS is to find the shortest path between the root and the given nodes.
To implement BFS, one should use the queue data structure.</description>

      <title>Redirection of stdout and stderr to the same file</title>

      <description>Often, when running a program in console, one needs to save all its output to a file. Very often, such a program writes both to the standard output (stdout) and to the standard error output (stderr). For example, by default, in a Python program the print function writes to stdout and the functions of the logging module to stderr. Therefore, one needs to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file.</description>
