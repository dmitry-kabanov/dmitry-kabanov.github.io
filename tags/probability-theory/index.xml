      <description>Basic terms in probability theory are outcomes, sample space, events, and probability measure.
Outcomes and sample space . When you conduct a random experiment, there is a set of possible results of this experiment. This results are called outcomes. All possible outcomes together form a set, which is called sample space. It is customary to denote outcomes with \(\omega\) and sample space with \(\Omega\): \[ \Omega = \{ \omega \text{ such that } \omega \text{ is an outcome of random experiment} \}.</description>
