      If you use Slurm job manager to run jobs on shared cluster, it often occurs that your job reaches the time limit and is terminated by Slurm. To allow a user to deal with the job termination, Slurm does this in two stages: first, the job receives SIGTERM signal that indicates that the job will be killed soon, and then the job receives SIGKILL signal that actually kills it. The time interval between these two signals is specified via Slurm&rsquo;s configuration parameter KillWait.

      When one studies probability theory, a notion of a Borel $σ$-algebra arises. Here we will look at what this is.
First thing is to understand what $σ$-algebra means.
Let \(X\) be a set. Then if we have another set \(\mathcal B\), which we call σ-algebra over \(X\), if it has the following properties:
  it consists of subsets of \(X\),
  \(X \in \mathcal B\),
  for any \(b \in \mathcal B\), it follows that \(b^\C \in \mathcal B\), where superscript \(\C\) denotes complement,

Tensorflow 2 offers another mode of execution called Graph mode. In this mode, first the computational graph is created and then used to compute loss function and its gradient. This mode is more performance efficient.
