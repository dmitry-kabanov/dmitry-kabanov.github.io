One typical application of BFS is to find the shortest path between the root and the given nodes.
To implement BFS, one should use the queue data structure.

Hyperopt library is used to choose the hyperparameters, that is, parameters that must be set before the learning process. The learning process is the process of fitting a given model to some dataset, which is done by minimization of some function.
For example, when you fit model \(\hat f (x)\) by optimizing function \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( y_i - \hat f (x_i) \right)^2 + \lambda R(f), \]

I haven&rsquo;t read it but it has very high grades in reviews. The book is in Letter paper size and has 427 pages, so, I guess, it is worth considering buying an e-book version on the publisher&rsquo;s website.

      This is an introduction to using Hyperopt library. I will use mostly terminology of machine learning (ML) as this library appeared in the ML community.
Hyperopt library is used to choose the hyperparameters, that is, parameters that must be set before the learning process. The learning process is the process of fitting a given model to some dataset, which is done by minimization of some function.
For example, when you fit model \(\hat f (x)\) by optimizing function \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( y_i - \hat f (x_i) \right)^2 + \lambda R(f), \]
