      <description>For my new position, I need to improve my knowledge of the C++ programming language (which I did not use basically since 2010). So I have started reading the book Discovering Modern C++ by Peter Gottschling to get up to speed with, well, modern C++.
In this post, I would like to talk about universal initialization (a.k.a. brace-initialization) that was introduced in C++11.
The syntax for the universal initialization is the following:</description>

      <description>If you work on an M1 Mac computer (that is, on an Apple computer with an ARM processor) and use Conda to manage Python environments and packages, sometimes you need to work with packages that are available only for x86_64 architecture, that is, for Macs with Intel processors (x86_64 is a common name for 64-bit Intel processors). For example, I ran into this problem when I wanted to go through SnakeMake tutorial, and it turned out that many bioinformatics tools (needed for the tutorial) are not available for the M1 architecture.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As any programming language, JavaScript allows to pack useful things into
functions, and it is the key to good JavaScript knowledge, to use them
efficiently.
In this post, I describe three ways that the functions can be declared
in JavaScript,
talk about visibility of variables inside the functions,
how to have optional function arguments with default values,
how to create closures (functions, bound to outer variables),
and how to use recursion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2023/how-to-mirror-gitlab-repo-to-github/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; repo and would like to mirror it in your &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; account,
it can be set up directly in the GitLab repo settings.
Note that here we use new fine-grained tokens functionality of GitHub
(which is currently in beta, as of May 2023).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving Perfect Squares problem using breadth-first search</title>
      <link>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2023/solving-perfect-squares-via-bfs/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2023/solving-perfect-squares-via-bfs/</guid>
      <description>I was learning recently about solving problems that use breadth-first search (BFS). This is a family of computer science algorithms that traverse tree data structures &amp;ldquo;by levels&amp;rdquo;. That is, starting at the root, we process all nodes on level 1, then all nodes on level 2, etc.
One typical application of BFS is to find the shortest path between the root and the given nodes.
To implement BFS, one should use the queue data structure.</description>

      <title>How to reencode H.264 videos to H.265</title>
      <link>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2023/reencode-h.264-to-h/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2023/reencode-h.264-to-h/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had videos in H.264 codec that I wanted to reencode to H.265.
The reason is that H.265 (a.k.a. High Efficiency Video Codec, HEVC) is a more
modern and efficient format than H.264 (a.k.a. Advanced Video Codec, AVC),
which allows to keep the same quality with about twice less storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I make from time to time
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@dmitry-kabanov&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/dmitry.i.kabanov/&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tiktok.com/@dmitry.i.kabanov&#34;&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;
videos, which
I need to backup, it is always good to store your data in the most
storage-efficient format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Redirection of stdout and stderr to the same file</title>
      <link>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2023/redirect-stdout-stderr-same-file/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2023/redirect-stdout-stderr-same-file/</guid>
      <description>Often, when running a program in console, one needs to save all its output to a file. Very often, such a program writes both to the standard output (stdout) and to the standard error output (stderr). For example, by default, in a Python program the print function writes to stdout and the functions of the logging module to stderr. Therefore, one needs to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file.</description>

      <title>Get list of open files on external volume in macOS</title>
      <link>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2022/get-list-of-open-files-macos/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2022/get-list-of-open-files-macos/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes, when you try to eject an external volume (logical part of a disk), macOS fails to do this as some files are still open. Frequently, it is clear what files are open by which program and can be closed. However, not always so. It has just happened to me &amp;mdash; a file was open by stuck QuickLook app.
To find the list of open files on that volume:

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2022/javascript-control-flow/</guid>
      <description>Conditions To execute some block of code depending on a condition, the following constructions are used; they are exactly like in C programming language.
Simple if:
let x = 7; if (x &amp;gt; 5) { console.log(&amp;#34;x is greater than five&amp;#34;); } x is greater than five Construction if-else:
x = 3; if (x &amp;gt; 5) { console.log(&amp;#34;x is greater than five&amp;#34;); } else { console.log(&amp;#34;x is not greater than five&amp;#34;); } x is not greater than five And the conditions can be chained together:</description>

      <description>Recently I was attending the class on uncertainty quantification for partial differential equations. As a postdoc, I do participate in the class only partially, however, I have a group of students that I am helping with the homework.
The first homework required use of Monte Carlo methods with differential equations with random coefficients to estimate uncertainty in the solutions of these equations. As the person with experience in writing PDE solvers, I wrote the solver for the PDE that we used in this homework and shared it with others.</description>

      <title>Books on writing science</title>

      <description>To be successful in academia, it is very important to have a good skill in writing and to write often and productively. Because the good skill in writing is rarely taught, one should learn it from reading books on the topic.
Recommended books on this topic are:
Belcher W. Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks, Second Edition
I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it but it has very high grades in reviews. The book is in Letter paper size and has 427 pages, so, I guess, it is worth considering buying an e-book version on the publisher&amp;rsquo;s website.</description>

      <title>Basic terms in the probability theory</title>
      <link>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2021/basic-terms-probability-theory/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2021/basic-terms-probability-theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Basic terms in probability theory are outcomes, sample space, events, and
probability measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcomes and sample space&lt;/strong&gt;
.
When you conduct a random experiment, there is a set of possible results of this
experiment.
This results are called &lt;em&gt;outcomes&lt;/em&gt;.
All possible outcomes together form a set, which is called &lt;em&gt;sample space&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>When you write a paper in \(\LaTeX\) and your collaborators prefer to use Overleaf but you prefer to use local setup, then you can do it with the help of the git version control system.
Overall, the process is the following. You create a local git repository and sync it to a remote git service of your choice. Then you create a project in Overleaf. In the project settings you can find the link which you add to your git setup as the second remote server.</description>

      <title>How to handle python job cancelation in Slurm job manager</title>
      <link>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2020/04-job-cancelation-in-slurm/</link>

      <description>If you use Slurm job manager to run jobs on shared cluster, it often occurs that your job reaches the time limit and is terminated by Slurm. To allow a user to deal with the job termination, Slurm does this in two stages: first, the job receives SIGTERM signal that indicates that the job will be killed soon, and then the job receives SIGKILL signal that actually kills it. The time interval between these two signals is specified via Slurm&amp;rsquo;s configuration parameter KillWait.</description>

      <title>Saving state for tf.function-decorated functions</title>
      <link>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2020/03-saving-state-tf-function/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2020/03-saving-state-tf-function/</guid>
      <description>When you decorate a function with `tf.function` decorator, sometimes you need to keep state between invocations of this function.
The problem here is that the changes to the state will not be visible in the decorated function if the state is saved in the Python variables.
To illustrate the problem, Tensorflow 2.2 is used:
import tensorflow as tf print(tf.__version__) 2.2.0 To see the problem, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the following code. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that we need to scale a given Tensor `x` and we do it using `tf.</description>

      <title>Using `tf.function` for performance in Tensorflow 2</title>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2020/02-tf-function-performance/</guid>
      <description>Tensorflow 2 uses so called Eager mode by default. In this mode, it is easy to define tensors interactively, for example, in ipython and see their values. However, in Eager mode the execution is slow, which becomes noticable during model training.
Tensorflow 2 offers another mode of execution called Graph mode. In this mode, first the computational graph is created and then used to compute loss function and its gradient. This mode is more performance efficient.</description>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2020/01-hyperopt-basics/</guid>
      <description>This is an introduction to using Hyperopt library. I will use mostly terminology of machine learning (ML) as this library appeared in the ML community.
Hyperopt library is used to choose the hyperparameters, that is, parameters that must be set before the learning process. The learning process is the process of fitting a given model to some dataset, which is done by minimization of some function.
For example, when you fit model \(\hat f (x)\) by optimizing function \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( y_i - \hat f (x_i) \right)^2 + \lambda R(f), \]</description>

      <guid>https://dmitrykabanov.com/blog/2019/borel-sigma-algebra/</guid>
      <description>When one studies probability theory, a notion of a Borel $σ$-algebra arises. Here we will look at what this is.
First thing is to understand what $σ$-algebra means.
Let \(X\) be a set. Then if we have another set \(\mathcal B\), which we call σ-algebra over \(X\), if it has the following properties:
it consists of subsets of \(X\),
\(X \in \mathcal B\),
for any \(b \in \mathcal B\), it follows that \(b^\C \in \mathcal B\), where superscript \(\C\) denotes complement,</description>
