    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>To be successful in academia, it is very important to have a good skill in
writing and to write often and productively.
Because the good skill in writing is rarely taught, one should learn it from
reading books on the topic.</p>
<p>Recommended books on this topic are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Belcher W. <em>Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks</em>, Second Edition</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read it but it has very high grades in reviews.
The book is in Letter paper size and has 427 pages, so, I guess, it is worth
considering buying an e-book version on the <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo26985005.html">publisher&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schimel J. <em>Writing Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals
That Get Funded</em></p>
<p>This book I have partially read in 2020.
It is a wonderful book that explains how to write such that there is a story
and there are characters acting in this story.</p>
