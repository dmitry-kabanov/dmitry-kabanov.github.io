    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Recently I was attending the class on uncertainty quantification for partial
differential equations.
As a postdoc, I do participate in the class only partially, however, I have a
group of students that I am helping with the homework.</p>
<p>The first homework required use of Monte Carlo methods with differential
equations with random coefficients to estimate uncertainty in the solutions of
these equations.
As the person with experience in writing PDE solvers, I wrote the solver for the
PDE that we used in this homework and shared it with others.
Of course, after writing a solver, I wrote a test that the observed order of
accuracy is correct (second order, in this case) as I strongly believe that the
automated testing is superimportant in software and the test on the observed
order of accuracy is the best test for numerical solvers.</p>
<p>So, after writing the solver, I was sure that it worked correctly, and we
started to do Monte Carlo exercises with this solver.
It quickly turned out that we get some unexpected results.
Particularly, I was doing an exercise on rare-event simulation, however, the
event proposed in the exercise was not rare at all!
I&rsquo;ve spent some time trying to understand what could be wrong with my
importance-sampling Monte Carlo that I used for this rare-event simulation
but could not find any bugs.
I did not think that the problem could be with the PDE solver as I was sure it
worked correctly: I had a test that shows that the order of convergence is
correct, hence, there could not be any problem.</p>
<p>However, another student, who used my solver, told me that while estimating the
convergence rate of the bias error, she did not get an expected second rate but
only the first rate.
That finally made me convinced that the problem is with the PDE solver as the
convergence rate of the bias error directly depends on the convergence rate of
the PDE solver.</p>
<p>After two-hour investigation, with looking at the solver function and not seeing
any apparent mistakes, I have realized that the problem is that my test
suite for the PDE solver is too weak.
Indeed, having a single test that check convergence only for a particular PDE
with constant coefficients is not enough to ensure correctness of the solver.</p>
<p>The solver solves an equation of the elliptic type:</p>
<p>\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{div} \left( a(x, \omega) \, \nabla u(x, \omega) \right) &amp;= f(x),
\quad x \in D, \\\
u(x \in \partial D) &amp;= 0,
\end{aligned}</p>
<p>where the source term \(f(x)\) was given, so I hardcoded it into the solver
function.</p>
<p>As it was clear now that I need a test with coefficient \(a(x, \omega)\) being
nonconstant, I used the
<a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/759450/">method of manufactured solutions</a>
to develop this more stringent test.
Precisely, I chose the form of the coefficient \(a(x, \omega)\) and the solution
\(u(x, \omega)\) and then found the needed source term \(f(x)\) by substituting into
the equation.
Consequently, the solver function was generalized by adding an argument for the
callback of the source term.</p>
<p>After adding this test, it was clear that the solver does not give the correct
order of convergence: it was one instead of two!
Now, having the test, I started to analyze the solver again.
As the problem occurred only with the variable coefficient and not with the
constant one, it was clear that there is some problem with the construction of
the matrix \(A\) as elliptic equations are solved numerically by building the
system of linear algebraic equations:
\[
A u = f,
\]
where \(u\) and \(f\) are functions discretized on the grid.</p>
<p>Usually, the matrix \(A\) is a sparse matrix, and I used the function
<code>scipy.sparse.spdiags</code> to build it.
What I haven&rsquo;t realized initially, why programming the solver, that this
function has some unintuitive behavior when constructing upper diagonals.</p>
<p>Precisely, if you have the following vectors to build the tridiagonal matrix:</p>

correctly and passed both tests: for constant and variable coefficients.
We were able to use it for Monte Carlo simulations and finish the homework.</p>
<p>The point of this post is that when one needs to work on the multicomponent code
like in this case (Monte Carlo simulator plus PDE solver), it is crucial to test
the individual components of the code independently.
Moreover, it is crucial to write good tests: if tests are too “easy”, they
give a false feeling of safety.
Only when tests are strict enough, one can be sure that different software
components work correctly and can be used together to solve a computational task.</p>
