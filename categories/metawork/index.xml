      <description>To be successful in academia, it is very important to have a good skill in writing and to write often and productively. Because the good skill in writing is rarely taught, one should learn it from reading books on the topic.
Recommended books on this topic are:
Belcher W. Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks, Second Edition
I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it but it has very high grades in reviews. The book is in Letter paper size and has 427 pages, so, I guess, it is worth considering buying an e-book version on the publisher&amp;rsquo;s website.</description>
